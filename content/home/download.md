# Wasta-Linux: Downloads

*If you are unsure of which download may be best for your hardware, please use the link at the bottom of this page to post to the Wasta-Linux User Forum to ask for clarification.*

### {{< tabs "downloads" >}}

{{< tab "24.04.1" >}}

### [**Wasta-Linux-24.04.1**](https://www.wastalinux.org/downloads/isos/wl-24-04-1/WL-24.04.1.iso)
* ***updated:*** 2024-09-17
* ***md5:*** 5bf9ad7bbffb937eb288659536c44541

***Notes:***
* **Based on _Ubuntu 24.04.1 "Noble Numbat"_**
* **Interface:** *Cinnamon* is the default interface, with *Gnome (Ubuntu's default interface)* alternately available from the login screen
* **Long-Term Support:** Security updates provided by *Ubuntu* through **April 2029**
* **Linux Kernel:** 6.8 - This kernel version will not change so you will have more stability to your system if all of your hardware works well with it. If you have hardware requiring a newer Linux Kernel, post to the Wasta-Linux User Forum (links below) to ask for assistance.
* **SIL Software Availability:** Many SIL apps are available as traditional `.deb` packages for use in Wasta-Linux including the *App Builders*, *Adapt It*, and others. Due to a security design decision beyond our control, you will need to use *Synaptic Package Manager* (pre-installed) to find these SIL software applications.
  * However, traditional `.deb` versions of *.NET based SIL software* are not available for 24.04. Instead, `Flatpak` is used for distributing *Fieldworks* and *Bloom*, and `Snap` is used to distribute *Paratext (9.0)* and *Paratext Lite.* The *Software* application can be used to search for and install these applications.

### [**Wasta-Linux-22.04.3-64Bit**](https://www.wastalinux.org/downloads/isos/wl-22-04-3/WL-22.04.3-64bit.iso)
* ***updated:*** 2023-08-17
* ***md5:*** dd5552d203db8512f448ceff1a556412

***Notes:***
* **Based on _Ubuntu 22.04.3 "Jammy Jellyfish"_**
* **Interface:** *Cinnamon* is the default interface, with *Ubuntu Gnome-Shell* also installed
* **Long-Term Support:** Security updates provided by *Ubuntu* through **April 2027**
* **UEFI Compatible:** Fully compatibleÂ with newer *UEFI* firmware. *NOTE:* in early 2023 Ubuntu needed to update their *Secure Boot* keys, meaning you will need to disable *Secure Boot* in your machine's BIOS. Sorry for the inconvenience.
* **Linux Kernel:** 6.2 - Thanks to Ubuntu's *HWE (HardWare Enablement)* support. When Ubuntu releases newer Linux Kernels from their interim releases (23.10, etc.), you will automatically be upgraded to these newer kernels. For this reason, it is recommended to use the 24.04.1 ISO if your hardware runs well with it as this version will *NOT* have it's kernel version change.
* **SIL Software Availability:** Many SIL apps are available as traditional `.deb` packages for use in Wasta-Linux including the *App Builders*, *Adapt It*, and others. Due to a design decision beyond our control, you will need to use *Synaptic Package Manager* (pre-installed) to find these SIL software applications.
  * However, traditional `.deb` versions of *.NET based SIL software* are not available for 22.04. Instead, `Flatpak` is used for distributing *Fieldworks* and *Bloom*, and `Snap` is used to distribute *Paratext (9.0)* and *Paratext Lite.* The *Software Manager* application can be used to search for and install `flatpak` applications, and the *Snap Store* application can be used to search for and install `snap` applications.
